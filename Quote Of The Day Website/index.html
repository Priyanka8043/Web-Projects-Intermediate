<!-- The <blockquote> tag specifies a section that is quoted from another source.
    The <blockquote> tag in HTML is used to display long quotations (a section that is quoted from another source). It changes the alignment to make it unique from others. It contains both opening and closing tags. In blockquote tags, we can use elements like headings, lists, paragraphs, etc
    The block quote is used for direct quotations that are longer than four lines of prose, or longer than three lines of poetry. A block quote is always used when quoting dialogue between characters, as in a play. The block format is a freestanding quote that does not include quotation marks.
